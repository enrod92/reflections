What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

> A git hidden folder is created (repository metadata), which needed for being able to do version control on all files
in the directory, and subdirectories where the repository was initialized.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

> It's a logical temporary place for adding the files whose changes will be committed. Contrary to the working directory which is persistent
and the actual location of files, or the repository which is a logical aggrupation of files that will undergo version control in conjunction.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

> Add only the affected files modified by the overall logical change. That way every commit will detail a single significant change and details
of only the files that are part of that update.
