When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
> When you work from multiple workstations for you to be able to sync the content on them all with the latest version.
> When you are collaborating with other peers in the development of a project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
> If it was to do it manually it could conflict with any current work you haven't finished just yet. Also, it could mean quite an amount of information that
we don't need just yet, and we can leave the sync for later.
